![](https://github.com/asikhalaban/Smart-Watch-Phone-App/blob/master/img/smart-phone-app-650.jpg)

In This Github, I want to share some of my experience regarding to an app that I'm developing for smartwatch and smartphone. Unfortunately, I'm not able to share whole my algorithm and code but I try my best to explain the most important and difficult part of SmartWatch application and Deeplearning that could be useful for other projects.But, my main focus is on ETL and analyzing dataset from smart watch/phone app.   
You can reach me at my email asikhalaban@gmail.com for any questions or suggestions.
