# Smart Watch/Phone App

![](https://github.com/asikhalaban/Smart-Watch-Phone-App/blob/master/img/smart-phone-app-650.jpg)

In This Github, I want to share some of my experience regarding to an app that I'm developing for smartwatch and smartphone. Unfortunately, I'm not able to share whole my algorithm and code but I try my best to explain the most important and difficult part of SmartWatch application and Deeplearning that could be useful for other projects.But, my main focus is on ETL and analyzing dataset from smart watch/phone app.   
You can reach me at my email asikhalaban@gmail.com for any questions or suggestions.

### a. A Road Map for Reader and Structures

As I mentioned earlier in this Github I cannot share whole my project and algorithm but I try my best to share my experience through this project. Are you intereted to know about my project? It is about detection some human motion analysis from smartwatch sensors by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

In next chapter, you can see the methods and features that I selected to collect and extract data from smartwatch. In chapter 3, I explained some of machine learning methods and my experience regarding to analyze data and signals from previous chapter. In the last chapter, I don't know still do I have to add it or not :D 

Again, please contact me either on asikhalaban@gmail.com or asikhalaban@yahoo.com for any questions or suggestions. Working Hard and Have Fun! ;)
