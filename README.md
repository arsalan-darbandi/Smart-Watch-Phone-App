# Smart Watch/Phone App

![](https://github.com/asikhalaban/Smart-Watch-Phone-App/blob/master/img/smart-phone-app-650.jpg)

In This Github, I want to share some of my experience regarding to an app that I'm developing for smartwatch and smartphone. Unfortunately, I'm not able to share whole my algorithm and code but I try my best to explain the most important and difficult part of SmartWatch application and Deeplearning that could be useful for other projects.But, my main focus is on ETL and analyzing dataset from smart watch/phone app.   
You can reach me at my email asikhalaban@gmail.com for any questions or suggestions.

### a. A Road Map for Reader and Structures

First, Section 2 describes the most important part which is data mining. Lots of information about data and different purposes and types of data processing can be find in this section. Then, Section 3 is about Machine Learning which is mixed and related to data mining and some of the materials in this section are similar to previous section. Section 4 and 5 are about two important languages which are used for data processing and commands and helps are brought over these two sections.
